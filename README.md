My new pet language, an HDL (hardware description language).

Example code in the example folder.

(Warning: mostly discontinued at this point because my most updated version was stored on my computer and lost, and I haven't been able to build the motivation to continue, and I feel that with a complete redesign I could make something significantly better)
